Outside the algo tm
- Spotify pushes the _same_ artists on us over and over. It's cool but also stops from getting to know new, fresh, and awesome artists. 
- outside the algo is just that - lovers of music like you send up songs ![here](https://ishortn.ink/ota) of cool up and coming artists
- We choose 30 songs every week from the responses to post in the playlist
- After a week - a fresh new playlist will be made of a new batch of 30 songs
- thats about it
