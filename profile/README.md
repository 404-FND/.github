- Spotify pushes the _same_ artists on us over and over. It's cool but also stops from getting to know new, fresh, and awesome artists. 
- outside the algo is just that - lovers of music like you send up songs here: [ðŸ”¥ form](ishortn.ink/ota)
- We choose 30 songs every week from the responses to post in the playlist
- After a week - a fresh new playlist will be made of a new batch of 30 songs
- Check out the playlist here: [ðŸŽ¶ Spotify â€“ Weekly Random 30](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6RGCx7L6xcwYGr9a9V2C72?si=MTd2G9g-S5ajc2pTNOmx0g)
